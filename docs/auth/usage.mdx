Once installed, you can access the [`firebase_auth`](!firebase_auth) plugin by importing it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
```

Before using Firebase Auth, you must first have ensured you have [initialized FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).

To create a new Firebase Auth instance, call the [`instance`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth.instance) getter on [`FirebaseAuth`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth):

```dart
FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;
```

By default, this allows you to interact with Firebase Auth using the default Firebase App used whilst installing FlutterFire on your
platform. If however you'd like to use a secondary Firebase App, use the [`instanceFor`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth.instanceFor) method:

```dart
FirebaseApp secondaryApp = Firebase.app('SecondaryApp');
FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instanceFor(app: secondaryApp);
```

## Authentication state

Firebase Auth provides many methods and utilities for enabling you to integrate secure authentication into your new or existing
Flutter application. In many cases, you will need to know about the authentication _state_ of your user, such as whether they're
logged in or logged out.

Firebase Auth enables you to subscribe in realtime to this state via a [`Stream`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Stream-class.html).
Once called, the stream provides an immediate event of the user's current authentication state, and then provides subsequent events whenever
the authentication state changes.

To subscribe to these changes, call the `authStateChanges()` method on your [`FirebaseAuth`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth) instance:

```dart
FirebaseAuth.instance
  .authStateChanges()
  .listen((User user) {
    if (user == null) {
      print('User is currently signed out!');
    } else {
      print('User is signed in!');
    }
  });
```

The stream returns a [`User`](!firebase_auth.User) class if the user is signed in, or `null` if they are not. You can read more
about managing your users below.

If you need authentication state change events along with any user token refresh events, you can subscribe via the
`idTokenChanges()` method instead.

Alternatively, if you need all user change events which also include authentication state changes and id token changes, you can subscribe via the
`userChanges()` method. This stream provides realtime updates to the `User` class without having to call `reload()`, such as when credentials are linked,
unlinked and when the user's profile is updated.

## Persisting authentication state

The Firebase SDKs for all platforms provide out of the box support for ensuring that your user's authentication state is persisted across
app restarts or page reloads.

On native platforms such as Android & iOS, this behaviour is not configurable and the user's authentication state will be persisted on-device
between app restarts. The user can clear the apps cached data via the device settings which will wipe any existing state being stored.

On web platforms, the user's authentication state is stored in [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
If required, you can change this default behaviour to only persist authentication state for the current session, or not at all. To configure
these settings, call the `setPersistence()` method (note; on native platforms an [`UnimplementedError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/UnimplementedError-class.html))
will be thrown):

```dart
// Disable persistence on web platforms
await FirebaseAuth.instance.setPersistence(Persistence.NONE);
```

## Sign-in methods

Firebase provides a number of ways to sign users into your application, from anonymous users, password authentication,
phone authentication and using OAuth/social providers.

Before using any sign-in methods, ensure you have configured the [sign-in methods](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers)
on the Firebase console.

## Anonymous sign-in

Even though many applications do not require the user to explicitly sign into an application, it is important that you are able
to uniquely identify your users (for both analytical and security reasons). Anonymous sign-in provides an extra layer of security if
using Firebase Firestore, Realtime Database or even an external API, since you're able to detect whether a request comes from an authenticated user.

If no previous anonymous account on the platform (for your specific application) has been created, when signing in anonymously Firebase
will create a new unique user which will be persisted across app restarts/page reloads. If the user signs-out and reauthenticates
anonymously again, they will be signed-in with the previously created account. It is however important to remember the anonymous account created
will not be persisted if the user uninstalls the application, clears their browser storage or uses a private browsing method (e.g.
incognito mode on Google Chrome).

To get started, call the `signInAnonymously()` method on the [`FirebaseAuth`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAuth) instance:

```dart
UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInAnonymously();
```

Once successfully resolved, the user will be granted an anonymous account. If you are listening to changes in
[authentication state](#authentication-state), a new event will be sent to your listeners.

To learn more about how you can handle any errors which are thrown from the method, view the [Error Handling](error-handling)
documentation.

## Email/Password Registration & Sign-in

Email/Password is a common user sign in method for most applications. This requires the user to provide an email address
and secure password. Users can register new accounts with a method called `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` or sign in to
an existing account with `signInWithEmailAndPassword()`.

### Registration

To create a new account on your Firebase project call the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` method with the user's email address
and password:

```dart
try {
  UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: "barry.allen@example.com",
    password: "SuperSecretPassword!"
  );
} on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
  if (e.code == 'weak-password') {
    print('The password provided is too weak.');
  } else if (e.code == 'email-already-in-use') {
    print('The account already exists for that email.');
  }
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}
```

The method is a two-step operation; it will first create the new account (if it does not already exist and the password is valid) and
then automatically sign in the user in to that account. If you are listening to changes in [authentication state](#authentication-state),
a new event will be sent to your listeners.

To learn more about how you can handle any errors which are thrown from the method, view the [Error Handling](error-handling)
documentation.

### Sign-in

To sign-in to an existing account, call the `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` method:

```dart
try {
  UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: "barry.allen@example.com",
    password: "SuperSecretPassword!"
  );
} on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
  if (e.code == 'user-not-found') {
    print('No user found for that email.');
  } else if (e.code == 'wrong-password') {
    print('Wrong password provided for that user.');
  }
}
```

Once successful, if you are listening to changes in [authentication state](#authentication-state), a new event will be sent to your
listeners.

### Verifying a users email

Even though the above authentication flows sign a user into your application, they can provide any valid email address even if they
do not have access to that email address. In many cases, you may wish to make a user verify the provided email address before you
grant them full access to your application.

The [`User`](!firebase_auth.User) class provides a `sendEmailVerification()` method and `emailVerified` property which you can use to handle
this scenario.

For example, once signed in you can check the property and send an email verification to the user:

```dart
User user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;

if (!user.emailVerified) {
  await user.sendEmailVerification();
}
```

Firebase will send an automated email to the user with a unique code. This code can then be entered via the `applyActionCode()` method.
You can first check whether the code is valid by using the `checkActionCode()` method:

```dart
FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;

// Get the code from the email:
String code = 'xxxxxxx';

try {
  await auth.checkActionCode(code);
  await auth.applyActionCode(code);

  // If successful, reload the user:
  auth.currentUser.reload();
} on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
  if (e.code == 'invalid-action-code') {
    print('The code is invalid.');
  }
}
```

To learn more about how you can handle any errors which are thrown from the method, view the [Error Handling](error-handling)
documentation.

## Signing Out

To sign a user out, call the `signOut()` method:

```dart
await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
```

If you are listening to changes in [authentication state](#authentication-state), a new event will be sent to your
listeners.

## Other sign-in methods

Firebase also supports authenticating with external provides. To learn more, view the documentation for your authentication method:

- [Apple Sign-In.](social#apple)
- [Facebook Sign-In.](social#facebook)
- [Twitter Sign-In.](social#twitter)
- [Google Sign-In.](social#google)
- [Phone Number Sign-In.](phone)

## User management

Once authenticated, FlutterFire provides you access to the user via the [`User`](!firebase_auth.User) class. The class stores the
current information about the user such as their unique user ID, any linked provider accounts and methods to manage the user.

The [`User`](!firebase_auth.User) class is returned from any [authentication state](#authentication-state) listeners, or as part of
a [`UserCredential`](!firebase_auth.UserCredential) when using authentication methods. If you are sure the user is currently signed-in,
you can also access the `User` via the `currentUser` property on the `FirebaseAuth` instance. The examples below show how to access the
user:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="currentUser"
  values={[
    { label: 'currentUser', value: 'currentUser', },
    { label: 'Sign-in Methods', value: 'methods', },
    { label: 'State Listener Stream', value: 'stream', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="currentUser">

```dart
FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;

if (auth.currentUser != null) {
  print(auth.currentUser.uid);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="methods">

```dart
UserCredential userCredential = await Firebase.auth.signInAnonymously();

print(userCredential.user.uid);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="stream">

```dart
FirebaseAuth.instance
  .authStateChanges()
  .listen((User user) {
    if (user != null) {
      print(user.uid);
    }
  });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deleting a user

If your user wishes to delete their account from your project, this can be archived with the `delete()` method. Since this is a
security-sensitive operation, it requires that user must have recently signed-in. You can handle this scenario by catching the error, for
example:

```dart
try {
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser.delete();
} catch on FirebaseAuthException (e) {
  if (e.code == 'requires-recent-login') {
    print('The user must reauthenticate before this operation can be executed.');
  }
}
```

### Reauthenticating a user

As mentioned above, some operations such as deleting the user, updating their email address or providers require the user to have recently
signed in. Rather than signing the user out and back in again, the `reauthenticateWithCredential()` method can be called. If a recent login
is required, create a new [`AuthCredential`](!firebase_auth_platform_interface.AuthCredential) and pass it to the method. For example,
to reauthenticate with email & password, create a new [`EmailAuthCredential`](!firebase_auth_platform_interface.EmailAuthCredential):

```dart
// Prompt the user to enter their email and password
String email = 'barry.allen@example.com';
String password = 'SuperSecretPassword!';

// Create a credential
EmailAuthCredential credential = EmailAuthProvider.credential(email, password);

// Reauthenticate
await FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser.reauthenticateWithCredential(credential);
```

Reauthentication also works if you are using an OAuth credential instead.

### Linking user accounts

You can allow your users to sign into your application using multiple providers by linking authentication credentials to
existing user accounts. Users can then be identified using their Firebase UID, regardless of the provider they used to sign in.

The user must first be logged in to one of the accounts you want to link the new provider to. You can then log the user into the second provider,
and pass that `AuthCredential` to the `linkWithCredential` method from the first UserCredential:

```dart
Future<void> linkGoogleAndTwitter() async {
  // Trigger the Google Authentication flow.
  final GoogleSignInAccount googleUser = await GoogleSignIn().signIn();
  // Obtain the auth details from the request.
  final GoogleSignInAuthentication googleAuth = await googleUser.authentication;
  // Create a new credential.
  final GoogleAuthCredential googleCredential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
    accessToken: googleAuth.accessToken,
    idToken: googleAuth.idToken,
  );
  // Sign in to Firebase with the Google [UserCredential].
  final UserCredential googleUserCredential =
    await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(googleCredential);

  // Now let's link Twitter to the currently signed in account.
  // Create a [TwitterLogin] instance.
  final TwitterLogin twitterLogin = new TwitterLogin(
    consumerKey: consumerKey,
    consumerSecret: consumerSecret
  );
  // Trigger the sign-in flow.
  final TwitterLoginResult loginResult = await twitterLogin.authorize();
  // Get the logged in session.
  final TwitterSession twitterSession = loginResult.session;
  // Create a [AuthCredential] from the access token.
  final AuthCredential twitterAuthCredential =
    TwitterAuthProvider.credential(
      accessToken: twitterSession.token,
      secret: twitterSession.secret
     );
  // Link the Twitter account to the Google account.
  await googleUserCredential.user.linkWithCredential(twitterAuthCredential);
}
```
