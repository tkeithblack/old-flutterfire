title: iOS Installation

Before using FlutterFire on iOS, you must first connect to your Firebase project with your iOS application.

## Generating a Firebase project configuration file

On the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/overview), add a new iOS app or select an
existing iOS app for your Firebase project. The "iOS bundle ID" must match your local project bundle ID. The bundle ID
can be found within the "General" tab when opening `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` with Xcode.

Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for the Firebase app.

## Installing your Firebase configuration file

Next you must add the file to the project using Xcode (adding manually via the filesystem won't link the file to the
project). Using Xcode, open the project's `ios/{projectName}.xcworkspace` file. Right click the project name within Xcode
and select "Add files", as seen below:

Select the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file you downloaded, and ensure the "Copy items if needed" checkbox is enabled:

## Initializing FlutterFire

Once complete follow the instructions on [Initializing FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).
